## Overview:
By looking into Open University Data Student Data, we aim to create a model that can be used to answer questions regarding this data and develop relationships

## Aim
Get a general understanding of the data. (Total students, gender ratio, geography of students).
Then use machine learning the following questions:
 - Are there factors that cause some students to be more prone to dropping out than others.
 - Does IMBD_BAND affect the success of the student.
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree model
     - Deep Learning Model
 - How does Student interaction affect the final score
     - Deep Learning Model

## Data Cleanup and Analysis
create_db.ipynb was used to turn the 6 csv's that contained data into an SQL Database. From there, the database can be accessed to make pandas dataframes and then analysis can begin.
This includes:
- Merging Dataframes together
-
