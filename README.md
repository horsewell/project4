## Overview:
By looking into Open University Data Student Data, we aim to create a model that can be used to answer questions regarding this data and develop relationships

## Aim
Get a general understanding of the data. (Total students, gender ratio, geography of students).
Then use machine learning the following questions:
1. Are there factors that cause some students to be more prone to dropping out than others?
2. Does IMBD_BAND affect the success of the student?
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree model
     - Deep Learning Model
3. How does Student interaction affect the final score?
     - Deep Learning Model

## Data Cleanup and Analysis
create_db.ipynb was used to turn the 6 csv's that contained data into an SQL Database. From there, the database can be accessed to make pandas dataframes and then analysis can begin.
This includes:
- Merging Dataframes together


1. Basic Data Overview:
   - 32,593 instances of students joining a course. 28, 785 being completely unique students (Unique Student ID's)
   - Students come from 13 different Regions with Scotland being the region with the most students and Ireland being the least
  (Insert Graph)
   - There are slightly more Male students over Female students. With 17,875 males students vs 14,718 students.
   (Insert Graph)
   - Passing is the highest "Final Result", however if you combine Passing with Distinction and Withrdrawal with Failing. Then Failing is higher.

1. Are there factors that cause some students to be more prone to dropping out than others.
   
2. Does IMBD_BAND affect the success of the student.

3. How does Student interaction affect the final score
